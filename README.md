I don't like having a separate repo for different projects.  Nothing to really branch yet.

SimpleTableEdit: Playing around with the UITableView.
1. Functionality: add, edit (of the existing rows), delete, move.
2. Limitations: fixed sections (on creation)
3. Text only

Examples:
A few projects to do some dead simple iOS apps.  Mix of Objective-C and Swift.
